Credential Sniffer for SKYWIFI

# How it works
The sniffer uses scapy to sniff all packets and filter through http packets\
And when a packet that is directed to the router contains the credentials, they get printed to screen\
If you wish to implement another kind of router too please contact me on discord: Echowo#0423
